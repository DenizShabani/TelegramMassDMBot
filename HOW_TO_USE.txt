==STEPS TO USE==

step 1: Storing accounts using manager.py for scraping and adding purposes

i) Open terminal in the Genisys directory and enter command
>>> python manager.py
ii) If you wanna enter new accounts, choose option 1
    Enter Api id, Api hash and phone number
    if you want to add more accounts, enter 'y' ; if not then enter 'n' and hit enter
iii) If you wanna filter all banned accounts, choose option 2. It'll delete all banned accounts
iv) To show all accounts, choose option 3
v) To delete accounts, choose option 4
   Then choose an account to delete and hit enter


step 2: Scraping members using scraper.py

i) Run in terminal >>> python scraper.py
ii) Choose an account in order to scrape and hit enter
iii) Can only scrape public groups
     Suppose public group username is @ThisGroup. Enter only 'ThisGroup'. Omit '@' and hit enter
     Then it'll ask whether you want to filter or not
     Then it'll scrape members
 
     

step 3: Adding members using tsadder.py

i) Launch in terminal >>> python tsadder.py
ii) It'll create sessions and will ask for login code if not logged in. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE LOGIN CODE,
    PRESS 's' AND HIT ENTER TO SKIP
iii) Then enter number of accounts to use
EACH ACCOUNT WILL GET 40 USERS TO MESSAGE. IT MAY BE LESS THAN 40 DUE TO PRIVACY RESTRICTIONS OR PEER FLOOD ERROR
iv) Then read the warning and press enter to proceed
v) It'll launch scripts and it'll DM members


==TROUBLESHOOTING==

1) Members not being messages

Ans- It may be because the account is probably limited. Try other accounts

2) Error while logging in

Ans- If you have 2 factor authentication on, turn it off. After login, you can turn it on again
